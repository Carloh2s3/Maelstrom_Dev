Maelstrom is not meant as a serious game, just something to practise GML code.
the gameplay is going to consist of shooting stuff and using your wits to survive.
you have 6 tools/weapons, small beam, big beam, missiles, fire, ice and Neutra, not really a weapon, but useful as utility.
you also have a dynamic heat gauge, which increases as you use fire- or beam type weapons.
it decreases as you use Neutra or the Ice weapon or over time.
if the heat gauge goes up too far, you will catch fire.
if it becomes too low, your ship will freeze, and the engines are disabled. you can still use your weapons.
your enemy will use weapons to adjust your heat gauge, like fire or ice projectiles.

beam weapons are free to use and don't adjust your heat level that much.
elemental weapons cost you energy to use and adjust your heat gauge dramatically, but have high damage output and can apply certain effects.
missiles are limited, so you should restock after every level.
and finally, neutra doesn't cost energy, it restores your energy, and it restores your overheat/freeze status quickly.

enemies will have intelligent AI, and will not hesitate to kill you when you are distracted or when you let your guard down.
weapons of enemies will NOT consist of slow bullets and charged lasers before they are fired, no. they will consist of fast to almost unevadeable
bullets, huge spreads of bullets, sneaky attacks to try and hit you. and, of course, the charged laser is still here, but it is much wider than you would expect.
this game will be hard, and if you don't pay attention to the rythm in which the enemies attack , you will have a bad time.

fortunately, your arsenal doesn't only consist of weapons, you also have lots of cool utilities.
like the primary neutra, which will make an energy wave, which pushes back enemies (not kill them).
the secondary neutra creates a force shield, with that you can deflect attacks or block lasers.
the primary small beam is a dash in the direction of the mouse, depending on the charge.
the secondary small beam will speed up al of your attacks for a short period of time.
the primary big beam charges a blast of plasma, which will damage enemies severely, especially big ones.
the secondary big beam creates a laser in front of you, damaging enemies very accurately.
the primary missiles launches a user-chosen amount of missiles in a direction.
the secondary missile launches a user-chosen amount of missiles around you, useful for tight situations and against asteroids.
the primary fire weapon creates an exploding fireball in a direction.
the secondary fire weapon drops a fire bomb.
the primary ice weapon creates a big frigid arrow, which you can use to launch at enemies, or to fight them off like you are holding a sword.
the secondary ice weapon 

all energy weapons/tools' primary/secondary functions use energy, except for the missiles. and yes, you can spam missiles and no, it is no good for your wallet.
in fact, the missiles can be the stongest weapon in the game.

i use this game to learn how to use Game Maker: Studio properly, by making complex AI and stuff.
