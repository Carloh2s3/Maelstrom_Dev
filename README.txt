Maelstrom is not meant as a serious game, just something to practise GML code.
the gameplay is going to consist of shooting stuff and using your wits to survive.
you have 6 tools of weapons, small beam, big beam, missiles, fire, ice and Neutra, not really a weapon, but useful as utility.
you also have a dynamic heat gauge, which increases as you use fire- or beam type weapons.
it decreases as you use Neutra or the Ice weapon or over time.
if the heat gauge goes up too far, you will catch fire.
if it becomes too low, your ship will freeze, and the engines are disabled. you can still use your weapons.
your enemy will use weapons to adjust your heat gauge, like fire or ice projectiles.
