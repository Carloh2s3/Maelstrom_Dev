modules Maelstrom:
these parts can be placed in one of three slots in your inventory. you cannot have spare modules.
if you buy a module with ALT, you can replace one of the three existing modules.
you can have multiple of the same module installed, remember that this is not aways wise for every level.
you'll find yourself buying modules for your ship constantly. modules are not neccesary for the completion of the game though.
every module works as an upgrade, even if a module looks purely aestethic.

0-close proximity detector: gives a 30% chance to evade bullets when hit. (bullets will change color to green if evasion is successful, als works on lasers/beams)
1-ancient novacore: beam weapons are 1.5 times more powerful, and the heat increase is nullified.
2-missile rack: you can carry an extra 100 missiles.
3-missile warheads: missiles are 1.3 times more powerful, and have a blast radius of 20.
4-absorbtion: force blast and force shield now absorb bullets, replenishing hull and energy a little. (bullets will change color to yellow if absorbed, does not work on lasers/beams)
5-discharge: force blast and force shield have an electrical element, and can now do damage.
6-aluminum heat bulk: heat reduces 2 times faster.
7-heating system: cold warms up 2 times faster.
8-overclock: all weapons fire 1.3 times faster.
9-thick carbonsteel plate: resistant against beams once per level, and (if armor isn't damaged by beam) damage is halved. (beams damage you severely)
10-reactive plating: as long as your energy lasts, reduces any incoming damage by one third.
11-energy capacitor: increases energy capacity by 100, and increases energy replenishment.
12-overcharge: charged weapons, such as plasma cannon, frigid arrow and fire blast, can be overcharged to 1.5 times their original strength.
13-legendary: all weapons are 1.2 times more powerful.
14-ace: movement speed acceleration and maximum speed becomes 1.5 times faster, also stops faster.
15-lockon system: allows beam type weapons to home into enemies, selected by the pilot. if no target is selected, the weapons will fire according to their original settings.
16-unmelting ice: Frigid arrow has 500 more health, ice bolt leaves a mist of cold behind (freezing enemies instantly), and ice mode works 1.5 times better. 
      being frozen is now harder to escape from, and your temperature goes down faster when using ice weapons.
17-black flames: flame blast has a 1.5 times bigger radius, fire bolt leaves a trail of ember behind (burning enemies who fly into it), and fire mode works 1.5 times better. 
      being set on fire is now harder to escape from, and your heat increases more when using fire weapons.
18-royal power: smaller enemies would rather stay at a distance from you now, bigger enemies are not affected.
19-Doujin style: all normal weapons fire differently. this module is not entirely aestethic, because of the fact that you can now spam every weapon. 
      a bullet of a weapon deals half the damage, but you fire almost 2.4 times more bullets.
